Semiotic Lexical Framework (SLF)
Overview
The Semiotic Lexical Framework (SLF) is a Python-based toolkit designed for the interactive management, transformation, and analysis of lexical data. It provides powerful modules for performing symbolic, phonetic, and acronym-based transformations, as well as dictionary scans and tree-based seed management. The framework is ideal for linguists, researchers, and developers working in the fields of semiotics, linguistics, and natural language processing.

Key Features
Interactive Command-Line Interface: Perform and track lexical transformations using an intuitive CLI.
Multiple Transformation Modes: Includes symbolic, phonetic, acronym, and dictionary-based transformations.
Tree-Based Seed Management: Navigate, branch, and log transformation paths in a tree structure.
Persistent Logging: Uses SQLite and JSONL for transformation and state history.
Rich Metadata Support: Leverage metadata and wordlists to enhance transformation capabilities.
File Structure
slf_transform_modual_interactive_v.0.0.3.py — Main interactive transformation module and CLI.
character_transforms.parquet — Metadata for character-level transformations.
wordlist.txt — (Optional) Wordlist for dictionary-based transformations.
transform_history.db — SQLite database for transformation logs.
seed_tree.jsonl — Logs state and history of transformation tree.
Getting Started
Install required Python packages:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the interactive module:
bash
python slf_transform_modual_interactive_v.0.0.3.py
Follow the CLI prompts to perform and manage lexical transformations.

Thank you for clarifying! Based on your description, here’s an updated README.md draft for your repository, focused on the fact that it mines symbolic information from lexical data (letters, phrases, or character sets):

Semiotic Lexical Framework (SLF)
Overview
The Semiotic Lexical Framework (SLF) is a Python toolkit designed to mine symbolic information out of lexical letters, phrases, or character sets. Through an interactive command-line interface, users can analyze, transform, and track linguistic data, uncovering hidden patterns and relationships within textual material.

Features
Symbolic Mining: Extracts symbolic, phonetic, and acronym-based information from input text.
Interactive CLI: Step through transformations and explorations interactively.
Tree-Based State Management: Tracks the evolution of transformations in a tree structure for easy navigation and branching.
Rich Logging: All operations and states are logged in SQLite and JSONL files for reproducibility and analysis.
Metadata and Dictionary Support: Uses customizable metadata and wordlists to guide and enhance transformations.
Typical Use Cases
Discover hidden symbolic relationships in names, words, or phrases.
Analyze phonetic or character-based patterns in text.
Experiment with lexical transformations for creative or research purposes.
Maintain a reproducible, navigable record of linguistic analysis.
Quick Start
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the interactive module:
bash
python slf_transform_modual_interactive_v.0.0.3.py
Follow the prompts to load metadata and begin mining symbolic information from your lexical data.
File Overview
slf_transform_modual_interactive_v.0.0.3.py: Main interactive mining and transformation script.
character_transforms.parquet: Character-level transformation metadata.
seed_tree.jsonl: JSONL log of all transformation nodes/states.
transform_history.db: SQLite database for persistent history and analysis.
wordlist.txt: (Optional) Wordlist for dictionary-based exploration.
